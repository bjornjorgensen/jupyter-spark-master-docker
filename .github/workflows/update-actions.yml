            ## Weekly GitHub Actions Version Check
            
            This is an automated check to remind you to review GitHub Actions versions.
            
            ### Current Actions in Use:
            
            **Main Build Workflow:**
            - \`actions/checkout@v5\`
            - \`docker/setup-qemu-action@v3\`
            - \`docker/setup-buildx-action@v3\`
            - \`docker/login-action@v3\`
            - \`docker/build-push-action@v6\`
            
            ### Recommended Actions:
            
            1. **Check for updates**: Visit each action's repository to see if newer versions are available
            2. **Review changelogs**: Check for breaking changes or security fixes
            3. **Test updates**: Update versions in a separate branch and test workflows
            4. **Update workflow files**: Apply updates after testing
